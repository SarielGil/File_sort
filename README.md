# File_sort

Having a bunch of mixed-up folders and required to get all the files to there respected extension folder this script could come in handy 

after running the script the results should look like:

-new_folder_name+date

|- doc

|- xls

|- xlsx



The script supports:

1. Unzipping files (win zip only for now)

2. Zips within zip's 

3. Keeping duplicated files

4. File type selection 



More to do:

1. Improve duplicate keeping 

2. Support other archive formats

3. Dealing with folders with "." in their name 

4. Dealing with files laking their extension
